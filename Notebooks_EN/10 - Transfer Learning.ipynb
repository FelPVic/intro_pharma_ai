To deal with large image datasets (among other things), PyTorch has its own library `torchvision`. This library provies important functions that we do not have in \"regular\" `torch`. \n",

Within these folders there are subfolders named after the labels of the images contained within each folder. E.g. the folder `beagel` contains only images of beagels.\n",

Also, the images still need to be converted to a `tensor`. In a last step we scale the data.
