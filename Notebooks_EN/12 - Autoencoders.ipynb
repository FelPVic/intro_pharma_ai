    "#### I did my best to minimize the training time. I had saved a model that was trained already. However, the server does not play along. Therefore it is best to just do something else for an hour when training. You don't have to train 100 epochs, you can end the training early via Kernel > Interrupt Kernel.\n",

    "In today's notebook we will deal with the so called **autoencoders**.\n",
    "Autoencoders are mostly trained through selfsupervised training.\n",
    "As a reminder, selfsupervised training refers to training neural networks where input and output are identical. So the goal is to recover the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what is the added value of a network that only recovers the input?\n",
    "In fact, we are not necessarily interested in the output of an autoencoder. Rather, we are interested in what happens in the middle of the network. \n",
    "This is because the real goal of autoencoders is to compress the data, that is, to represent it as effectively as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example image shows an autoencoder for images:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An autoencoder consists of two networks, an **encoder** and a **decoder**. The output of the encoder is used as input to the decoder. The encoder should learn to represent the data as effectively as possible in a low-dimensional space (latent space). This representation is usually simply a vector, also known as a **latent vector**. The decoder is trained to recover the original input using this latent vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can decide for ourselves how large the latent vector should be. Usually, a particularly small size is chosen to ensure greater compression.\n",
    "After successful training, the *latent vector* should contain enough information for the decoder to reconstruct the complete image, despite its small size. This means that this vector is sufficiently informative to describe the complete image. Actual applications go beyond simple reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, autoencoders are used to improve the quality of images. For this purpose, low-resolution images are used as input, and the output is the same image in its regular (higher) resolution. In this way, networks are trained that can later sharpen low-resolution images. \n",

    "Autoencoders exist not only for images, but also for text. RNNs are used for this purpose. \n",
    "In the last notebook we already discussed that the last hidden state of an RNN is a summary of the whole input sequence. In the example the hidden state $O_5$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output $O_5$ can already be understood as a projection of the entire sentence into the latent space. The hidden state $O5$ is thus the latent vector describing our sequence. Accordingly, the network that generated this vector is our encoder. So, all that is missing for our autoencoder is the decoder that can recover the original sequence from the latent vector. We will discuss how this works exactly using an example with smiles."

    "The problem is, if we use the actual first token of the original smile as the first token for the decoder, it's relatively easy to predict it correctly. Therefore, we the token `<sos>` as the first input for the decoder. This token does not contain any information about the input miles. Hence the first tokenfirst token is predicted based only on the hidden state/latent vector. It is also important to note that the output of the RNN (the new hidden state) first passes through a linear layer, which then predicts the correct token.\n",
