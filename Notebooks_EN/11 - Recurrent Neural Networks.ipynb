    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are another special form of neural networks. \n",
    "RNNs are mainly used for sequences that are arranged in a fixed order. In these cases, the order of the individual elements of the sequence is often crucial for the interpretation of the whole sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Languages as a classical example lend themselves immediately. This is because the ordering of a sentence influences the interpretation of the individual words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I am not a fan of this movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"*fan*\" has a positive connotation. But the \"*not*\" before the word, turns the interpretation around. That is, the word \"*fan*\" should be interpreted in the context of the whole sentence. \n",
    "However, RNNs can also be used in chemistry/pharmacy. For example, SMILES `strings` or protein sequences are suitable for RNNs. \n",
    "\n",
    " `()` have a strong influence on how individual parts of the smile can be interpreted.\n",

    "The general concept of an RNN is relatively simple:\n",
    "Word by word (or even character by character) a sentence (or Smiles) is passed through the network. \n",
    "The output layer is completely ignored at first, but after a word has passed through the network, the activations of the hidden layer ($h_1$) are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the example sentence \"*Hallo Welt*\" (Hello World) in the figure. $h_1$ here are the activations for the word \"Hallo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of RNNs, we also refer to the activations of the hidden layer as **Hidden State**. $h_1$ is the hidden state for the word \"*Hallo*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the second word is passed through the network. We want to calculate $h_2$, but to the activations of the word \"Welt\" we also add the activations $h_1$. So $h_2$ is a combination of the activations of \"Welt\", but also of \"Hallo\". The word \"Welt\" was interpreted together with the previous word.\n",

    "\n",
    "The hidden state of the last part of the sentence (\"*?* \"), called $O5$ ($h_5$) in the example, is a combination of all previous hidden states and the activations of \"*?* \".\n",

    "# Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we train our RNN, we need to get the data into the right format. Letters and words cannot simply be read by a neural network.\n",
    "As with the labels from the MNIST dataset (0-9), we can one-hot encode words or, in the case of Smiles, characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two smiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "`smiles = [\"CCN=C=O\", \"NC(=O)CC(=O)O\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six different symbols in total:\n",
    "`C`, `N`, `=`, `O`, `(`, `)` \n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent a `C` as a vector of length 6, which has a `1` at the first position and otherwise only zeros. We can also represent an `N` as a vector, except that we shift the `1` by one position.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this for all symbols in the smiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"C\" = [1,0,0,0,0,0]\n",
    "\"N\" = [0,1,0,0,0,0]\n",
    "\"=\" = [0,0,1,0,0,0]\n",
    "\"O\" = [0,0,0,1,0,0]\n",
    "\"(\" = [0,0,0,0,1,0]\n",
    "\")\" = [0,0,0,0,0,1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "These symbols are also often called **tokens**.\n",
    "We can encode a Smiles `string` using these rules. Encoding a Smiles `string` using these rules results in a matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"CCN=C=O\" -> np.array([[1,0,0,0,0,0],\n",
    "                      [1,0,0,0,0,0],\n",
    "                      [0,1,0,0,0,0],\n",
    "                      [0,0,1,0,0,0],\n",
    "                      [1,0,0,0,0,0],\n",
    "                      [0,0,1,0,0,0],\n",
    "                      [0,0,0,1,0,0]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `string` `\"CCN=C=O\"` becomes a matrix where each row is a token and each column indicates which symbols are assigned to that row.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the following code you can automate this conversion.\n",
    "Many functions are already customly written by us. But if you are still interested in exactly how these functions look like, you can find the code in the file `../utils/utils.py`."
